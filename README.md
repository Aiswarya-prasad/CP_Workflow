# CP_Workflow
The aim is to create a snakemake workflow to carry out the entire analysis of my Chronic Pancreatitis (CP) microbiome data and compare it with controls. The workflow aims to include, data organization, QC, Basecalling (Guppy for nanopore), Demultiplexing, Trimming and filtering, Taxonomic classification (using Kraken2 and Centrifuge) and comparitive analysis.
It also aims to include a compilation of all the analysis in the form of my Master thesis written in Latex.
